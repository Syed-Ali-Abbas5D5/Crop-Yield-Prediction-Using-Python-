# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Python-

In this project with the help of machine learning algorithms with analysis of neural networks we build a artificial application model for farmers which help them to predict the which crop is better and what would be appropriate price for the crop based on the prediction model by using some previous datasets with input fields like rainfall months and whole price index.
